# Week 10 | Advanced Lecture: PHP Introduction
Advanced lecture for East B November 22, 2021 cohort at Lighthouse Labs!

## What is PHP?
- Interpreted language (just like JS and Ruby!)
- 1994 by Danish-Canadian Rasmus Lerdorf
- Personal Home Page (Tools), a variety of scripts to show basic dynamic web features
- PHP Hypertext Preprocessor
- The most installed back-end scripting language on the web
- Over 70% of dynamic websites use it in-part or in-full
- Like JavaScript, PHP is fast to learn and very flexible
- Over 40% of dynamic websites use WordPress
- PHP has a popular MVC framework called Laravel
- PHP has a mature package manager (like npm) called composer

## I've heard bad things!!!
- The same freedom that we might love, may also cause messy or insecure code
- Because the PHP community is so large, and it is so widely used, we see a lot of bad code examples out there (much like JavaScript)
- Weakly-typed, doesn't force good-habits

## Good things about PHP!
- The development team (PHP Group) is very active, we're seeing new versions and features all the time!
- Huge community!
- It is used by industry giants like Facebook

## Installing PHP!
- You can install manually via the official site's instructions: https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php
- Ubuntu: `apt-get install php`
- Macintosh: `brew install php`
- Windows: `choco install php`

## Common Command-Line Options (PHP Interpretor)
- `php --version` Check if PHP is installed, and which version is handy!
- `php [path/to/file.ext]` Execute a file by path/name
- `php -a` Opens an interactive shell, great for quick tests!
- `php -r "[your test script]"` Good for quick one-line tests.
- `php -S [address]:[port]` Accessible local test server! (Not for production.)
