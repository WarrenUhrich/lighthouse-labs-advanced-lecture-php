## The ElePHPant in the Room...

* A lot of freedom... for better or for worse!
* Loosey goosey.
* There are lots of examples / tutorials out there... not all of them are good.
* There are inconsistencies in the function names.

## The Good!

* ElePHPant mascot! How cute...
* It is very, very widely usedâ€”that there are nearly endless resources out there!
* Well-documented!
* They have a LOT of built-in functions and features (esp. for web development) that other languages are missing out-of-the-box.
* Great performance (gives other interpreted languages a run for their money)
* MVC Framework: Laravel
* Package Manager: Composer

## How do I install/run PHP?

Check for the version you have installed first: `php --version`

If isn't already installed, consider:

* Windows: `choco install php`
* Linux: `sudo apt install php`
* Macintosh: `brew install php`

To run quick easy tests online, try:

## Common CLI Options

* `php --version` Check which version we're using.
* `php -a` Interactive shell!
* `php -r "[PHP Code here!]"` This is great for quick one-line experiments.
* `php [path/to/file.php]` Executes the target file.
* `php -S localhost:3000` Serves the current directory as a web server.
