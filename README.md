## What is PHP?

* Danish-Canadian named Rasmus Lerdorf
* Personal Home Page scripts!
* PHP Hypertext Preprocesser
* PHP can be used for CLI, GUI desktop, server-side web applications
* Weakly and dynamically typed
* Used to power the back-end of Facebook

## The ElePHPant in the room...

* It *was* slow for new releases
* Weakly / dynamically typed can make it difficult to trace values through code
* "Loosey goosey" like JavaScript
* Over 70% use PHP for back-end - there's going to be some bad code
* The functions are inconsistently named

## The Good!

* Easy to pick up
* Because it is so widely used, there are learning resources everywhere
* Well-documented
* Built-in functions for almost anything you need in web development
* Over 40% of websites use WordPress
* MVC framework: Laravel
* Package manager: Composer
